/// A Lasso 9 Capture value (`https://lassoguide.com/language/captures.html`)
/// — a stored block of Lasso code that can be invoked later. See
/// `Documentation/captures-subsystem-plan.md` for the full scoping pass this
/// implements Stages 1-3 of.
///
/// **Live-reference closure semantics** (Stage 3, see the plan doc's §4.2(a)
/// design decision) — a capture's body executes against the SAME storage
/// cells (`LassoLocalBox`, `Runtime.swift`) the enclosing scope's local
/// variables live in, not a value-type snapshot. Matches the Guide's own
/// canonical worked example (§1.5): a capture created in one method mutates
/// a local that method later reads back, after the capture is invoked from
/// a completely different method — this only works because
/// `capturedLocals` below holds REFERENCES to the same boxes the creating
/// scope's own `LassoContext.locals` holds, not copies of their values.
/// Stage 1's original cut used a plain value-type snapshot instead
/// (disclosed then as a deliberately narrower substitute); see
/// `LassoLocalBox`'s own doc comment for why boxing every local (not just
/// capture-adjacent ones) was the chosen fix over a scope-chain redesign
/// (§4.2(b)) — smaller blast radius, no change to this codebase's existing
/// flat-dictionary-per-call-frame scoping model.
///
/// **Stage 2 adds**: non-local `return`/`yield` through a capture's home
/// (see `Evaluator.invokeCapture`/`invokeCustomTag`/`invokeMemberMethod` for
/// the propagation mechanism, and `LassoContext.nonLocalReturnTargetDepth`/
/// `currentCaptureHomeDepthStack`) and `->detach()`. **`yield` is
/// implemented identically to `return`** for this stage — real Lasso's own
/// documented PC-preserving resume behavior (a capture that reached a
/// `yield` continues executing from the point AFTER that yield on its NEXT
/// invocation, cycling through a sequence: `1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...`) is
/// NOT implemented — every invocation of a capture (yielded-from or not)
/// re-executes its body from the top. This would need genuine resumable
/// (coroutine-like) execution of a tree-walking render pipeline that has no
/// such capability anywhere today — a materially larger, separate piece of
/// work than the non-local-propagation mechanism this stage does implement,
/// deliberately deferred (see the plan doc's own Stage 2 status note).
/// **Stage 7 adds**: `currentCapture()`, the member-method form of
/// `->givenBlock()` (distinct from the pre-existing bare `givenBlock`
/// keyword, which reads the same underlying per-invocation state via
/// `context.currentGivenBlock`), `->restart()`, and the auto-collect
/// buffer family (`->autoCollectBuffer()`/`->autoCollectBuffer=`/
/// `->invokeAutoCollect()`). See `Evaluator.invokeCapture`/
/// `LassoContext.currentCaptureStack` for `currentCapture()`'s tracking
/// mechanism, and this type's own `_autoCollectBuffer` below.
///
/// `->home()`/`->continuation()`/`->callSite_*`/`->callStack()`/
/// `->methodName()`/`->calledName()` remain deferred — a real home
/// CAPTURE reference (not just this type's own `homeDepth: Int` marker),
/// source-location tracking on AST nodes, and an implicit per-method-
/// invocation capture object (this codebase executes method bodies
/// directly via the tree-walking evaluator, never materializing a
/// `LassoCaptureValue` for them) are all deeper architectural rework this
/// stage's own research found zero corpus evidence justifying.
///
/// A dedicated `LassoValue` case rather than the usual
/// `.object(LassoObjectInstance)` wrapper every other native type in this
/// codebase uses, because a capture's payload (`[LassoNode]`, a
/// captured-locals snapshot) doesn't fit `LassoObjectInstance`'s
/// `[String: LassoValue]`-only data bag — the same reason `.pair` is also
/// its own top-level `LassoValue` case instead of an `.object`. Lock-
/// protected (`@unchecked Sendable`, mirroring `LassoObjectInstance`'s own
/// pattern) since Stage 2 introduces genuine post-construction mutation
/// (`->detach()`), unlike Stage 1's fully-immutable design.
